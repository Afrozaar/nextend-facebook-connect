One click registration & login plugin for Facebook? Easy installation? Is it totally free and comes with support? Yeah!

== Description ==

Personally, I hate to fill out registration forms, waiting for confirmation e-mails, so we designed this plugin for our website. Now, we want to share this very usable plugin with everyone, for free!
 
**Why should you choose Nextend Facebook Connect plugin from the many social plugins?**

* The plugin has multiple desings, so it fits all kind of websites smoothly and elegantly. - Soon
* Very simple to use.
